      <p>As a product manager, not only do I have to get shit done, but I also have to get the right shit done. As my seniority and responsibilities have increased, it‚Äôs become more and more important for me to build a system for managing my workload.</p>

      <p>Hello üëã, I‚Äôm Pete and I‚Äôve been working on a side-project to 100% automate my family‚Äôs grocery shopping. Here is what I‚Äôve been working on in the last few weeks.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.peteroome.com/2020/02/29/automating-our-weekly-groceries-version-1.html">So it‚Äôs been almost a month since my first post</a> about how I am automating my family‚Äôs grocery shopping - and a lot has changed in the world. Here we are, comfortably isolated at home, practicing the art of social distancing.</p>

      <p>I love food and I love cooking, but I loathe grocery shopping. Deciding what to cook and the time it takes to find the groceries (in-store and online) is painful. Like everyone else I‚Äôm kind of busy and would rather spend my spare time with my family and friends. In addition, I casually follow the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) mentality, minimising living costs where possible. I hate waste too - particularly food waste. So I have made it my mission recently to see what I can do to make this weekly chore less expensive, less wasteful and generally simpler.</p>

      <p>One of the first lessons you learn as a product manager is to build the right solution, you first need to speak to the people who are experiencing the problem you are solving.</p>
