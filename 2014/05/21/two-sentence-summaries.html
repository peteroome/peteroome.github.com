    <div class='meta'>
      <h4>21/05/2014, About a minutes read.</h4>
    </div>
    
    <p>I’ve met a lot of great people recently. Mostly entrepreneurs with great stories to tell, great ambition and an ever greater work ethics. These people are inspirational and what makes it even better (selfishly for me) is they’re experiencing the same problems I do, on a daily basis, as I do too. And they’re armed: with advice, with work/tech/marketing/life hacks and with ideas too.</p>

<p>So, I thought it would be sensible to start recording my meetings with these amazing people. You may consider this to be snapshot of my historical calendar. For me, this gives me a place where I can reflect on who I’ve met and remember to meet with them again in the future.</p>

<p>Two Sentence Summaries seemed like both a sensible approach to this personal documentation, as well a relatively suitable title for the series. So without further ado, here it is: #1.</p>

<p>Duncan is a very friendly and enthusiastic entrepreneur who I met through <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/weave-local-professional-networking/id788443696?mt=8">Weave</a> and talked to briefly before agreeing to meet 24 hours later. Duncan is working on his own self-funded app: <a href="http://signup.eripple.co/">eRipple</a> with an aim to connect entrepreneurs with mentors.</p>

<p><em>Note: Rob and I had an Americano each. Duncan didn’t have anything as he’d previously had a drink with his popular, off-radar, London Entrepreneur ‘self-help’ group.</em></p>
