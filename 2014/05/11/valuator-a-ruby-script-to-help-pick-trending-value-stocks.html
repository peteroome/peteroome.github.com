    <div class='meta'>
      <h4>11/05/2014, A couple of minutes read.</h4>
    </div>
    
    <p>I’ve always been curious about investing on the stock market. However, until recently i’ve neither had the knowledge, money or confidence to do so. Some of these things haven’t changed, but I have been doing a lot more reading around the subject.</p>

<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am not and do not claim to be an expert in investing. You should always do your own, thorough and detailed research, before investing in stocks. To this date (12/05/2014), I have not used this script to pick stocks I have then followed through and invested money into.</em></p>

<p>A few months back I stumbled across <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1eyx3r/how_do_you_select_stocks_contd_trending_value_see/">this Reddit thread</a>. I found it fascinating reading about the ‘program’ that SwellsInMoisture had developed and found myself reading this thread a few times over.</p>

<p>Seeing a few people asking if this would be of any use as a Python script got me thinking. Then I saw the comment by nicolamr who had turned the screener into a <a href="http://finance.nmr.io/">web app</a>. However, on inspection the site didn’t seem to work. Well, it worked but I couldn’t see any data from one of the listed snapshots.</p>

<p>With that being the case, I found <a href="">nicolamr’s repository on Github</a> and proceeded to convert it to Ruby. Not having really read any Python before I wasn’t sure what to expect. It turned out to be pretty straight forward though. Quite Ruby like actually. A few missing <code>end</code>’s and a couple of extra <code>;</code>’s.</p>

<p>Anyway, I now have my own functioning Trending Value Stock script/screener. The script pulls data from various sources (<a href="http://finviz.com/">finviz</a> and <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo finance</a>), before calculating the necessary rankings indicated by O’Shaughnessy in his book: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B005NASI8S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B005NASI8S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zoltarspeaks-21">‘What Works on Wall Street’</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-trending-value">Why Trending Value?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2011/12/13/values-to-hold-dear-when-youre-buying-stocks/">On the Forbes website</a>, O’Shaughnessy explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“if you want the best results over time, go with small cap stocks trading at lower-than-average multiples of earnings, sales and book value–and buy them when they’re trending higher. Momentum does matter as history shows that winners tend to keep on winning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our initial aim when it comes to picking our trending value stocks is to calculate a value composite. The value composite will measure undervaluation of a stock and replaces the common approach of simply using the price-to-sales ratio. It also provides us with another route towards portfolio diversitification; highly recommended when investing.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2011/12/13/values-to-hold-dear-when-youre-buying-stocks/">a video</a>, unfortunately no-longer available on the Forbes website] (you’ll have to take my word for it), O’Shaughnessy talks about the problem with single-factor valuation ratios. He explains that they move ‘in and out of favor’ and can significantly underperform the overall market over any given 10-year period, despite their long-term outperformance.</p>

<h2 id="the-value-composite">The Value Composite</h2>
<p>Our value composite is composed of six value measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp">Price to book value (p/b)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-salesratio.asp">Price to sales (psr or p/s)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda-ev-multiple.asp">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to Enterprise value (EV)(EV/EBITDA)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricetofreecashflow.asp">Price to free cash flow</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsrelative.asp">Price to earnings (p/e)</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_yield">Shareholder yield</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-trending-value-stock-screenscript">The Trending Value Stock Screen/Script</h2>
<p>Firstly, we shortlist all stocks with a market cap &gt; $200M.</p>

<p>We then assign each stock in our universe a score of 1 to 100 for each of the aforementioned value measures, in comparison to one another. Then calculate an average score from each of these values to create an overall value composite.</p>

<p>A “perfect” value stock will have a rating of 600 (or 100%)(a 100 score for each measure). However, a stock with a composite score &gt; 420 is normally a financially sound, well rounded company and undervalued too.</p>

<p>The script itself does this and generates a CSV file of our entire universe at the time of running it.</p>

<p>Our Trending Value Portfolio is then narrowed down to the 10% of stocks with the best average score. We sort the 10% by their trailing six-month performance (the trending part of this screen) and select the top 25 from the list.</p>

<p>At present I am doing this manually so I can clearly see the results of all the calculations and be sure that no silly errors have occured. I will then manually filter the 10% in the previously mentioned manner before selecting a final shortlist of 25.</p>

<h2 id="turnover">Turnover</h2>
<p>O’Shaughnessey rebalances his portfolio annually. The cost (commission) paid on investing in a portfolio of this size will cost you a fair whack hence only rebalancing annually. With that in mind, this script should only need to be run once a year - in theory.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>I am testing the results of my script using one of the many stocks apps available on iOS: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/stocks+-alerts-real-time-stock/id667161120?mt=8">Stocks+</a>. I picked an amount I wanted to ‘virtually’ invest and split it evenly amongst the 25 shortlisted companies.</p>

<p>It should also be possible to back test this script/screen using historical data. However, i’ve not gotten round to doing this yet.</p>
